before the rain stopped, the garden looked vibrant, before a week of dull, gray skies. before the sun emerged, the flowers began to bloom, before having drooped in the earlier gloom. before a few hours of warmth, the air felt fresh, before the damp chill had settled in. before all these changes, it was clear that before every storm, thereâ€™s a chance for renewal and growth.
