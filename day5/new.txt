After the rain stopped, the garden looked vibrant, after a week of dull, gray skies.
 After the sun emerged, the flowers began to bloom, after having drooped in the
 earlier gloom. After a few hours of warmth, the air felt fresh, after the damp
 chill had settled in. After all these changes, it was clear that after every storm,
  thereâ€™s a chance for renewal and growth.
